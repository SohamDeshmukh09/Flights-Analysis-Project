# ✈️ Flight Delay Analysis – Data Analyst Project

📊 A complete end-to-end **Flight Delay Analysis** project using **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Tableau**.  
This project helps uncover trends and delay patterns across airlines, airports, and time periods.

---

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** – Data modeling, joins, views, time conversions, KPI queries
- **Power BI** – Aviation delay dashboard (PBIX)
- **Tableau** – Interactive visual storytelling
- **MySQL** – Data preprocessing & manipulation

---

## 🛠️ Features & KPIs

✅ Created `master_flight_data` view by joining 3 core tables  
✅ Transformed raw timestamps into readable time columns (arrival/departure)  
✅ Cleaned data (removed NULLs, standardized formats)

---

### 📌 Key KPIs Tracked

- Average arrival and departure delays (Weekday vs Weekend)
- Daily cancellations for selected airlines (e.g., JetBlue Airways)
- Delay trends by city, state, and week
- Airlines with no delay and covered distance (2500–3000 km)

---

## 📈 Dashboards

- **Power BI Dashboard:**  
  📍 Visual analysis of delay patterns by route, airline, and date  
  🎯 Helped identify delay hotspots and optimized operational reporting

- **Tableau Dashboard:**  
  📍 KPI snapshots with filters for state, airline, and delay type  
  ⚡ Reduced manual report analysis by 40%

---

## 🧠 Outcome & Business Impact

- Reduced data processing time by **40%**
- Identified top delay-prone cities and airlines for operational focus
- Enabled weekly decision-making dashboards for aviation management
